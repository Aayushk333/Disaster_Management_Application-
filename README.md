## DEVELOPMENT OF CROSS PLATFORM MOBILE APPLICATION FOR CROWD SOURCING IN DISASTER MANAGEMENT

This project , titled , “DEVELOPMENT OF CROSS PLATFORM MOBILE APPLICATION FOR CROWD SOURCING IN DISASTER MANAGEMENT” , aims to reduce or avoid the potential losses from hazards, assure prompt and appropriate assistance to victims of disaster, and achieve rapid and effective recovery. Communication during disaster time is very crucial for both rescue team and victim. Emergency never comes with prior intimation. The System is intended to function in case of emergencies in society.The emergencies include Fire, Medical Emergencies, accident and External Emergencies (Earthquake, Floods, Storm). The system works on the principles of client-Server system, wherein the server responds to the requests of the Clients. 
The Disaster management cycle illustrates the ongoing process by which governments, businesses, and civil society plan for and reduce the impact of disasters, react during and immediately following a disaster, and take steps to recover after a disaster has occurred. Appropriate actions at all points in the cycle lead to greater preparedness, better warnings, reduced vulnerability or the prevention of disasters during the next iteration of the cycle. There are 4 phases of the CDM Cycle :










This project deals with the Response state of the CDM. It includes the actions carried out in a disaster situation with the objective to save life, alleviate suffering and reduce economic losses. The main tool in response is the implementation of plans which were prepared prior to the event. In this project I have developed a mobile app that can be used as an helpline portal for its users. The app is made in the DART language using the Flutter framework. Hence it is compatible with both Android and iOS. In this project I have used Firebase as the backend service.
